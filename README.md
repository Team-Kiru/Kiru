# Kiru

Thanks for trying out Kiru! This is a project I've taken a year or two to create, and it's still under active development.

## Installing Kiru

You'll need a few programs to get started.

-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [Java 11+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (Or remove commands/music.js)

Recommended to get:

-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

First, you'll need to clone the repo; and enter it, like all good programs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team-Kiru/Kiru.git
cd Kiru
```

Then, use NPM (or yarn, if you have it) to install the packages Kiru uses. This changes from time to time, so please remember to update often.

```bash
#If you have Yarn
yarn install

#If you're just using NPM
npm install
```

Once that's complete, you'll want to rename the config.default.json into config.json, and modify all the properties to your needs.

Once done, just run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Kiru should be running!

## Acknowledgements

The following software is used within our project:
[Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/), [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), [Node-json-config](https://github.com/Takayoshi-Aoyagi/node-json-config), [Enmap](https://github.com/eslachance/enmap)

I'll try my hardest to shorten this down and remove as many dependancies as possible! (◕⌂◕⊃⊃)T
